# RaidCrash

RaidCrash is a simple Discord bot originally created in **2021**, when I was just starting to learn programming.  
Because of that, the code is **very basic**, but it still works and can serve as an example for beginners who want to understand how bots interact with Discord servers.

## ⚠️ Educational Purpose Only

This project is intended **strictly for educational and learning purposes**.  
The goal is to help new developers understand:

- How Python bots operate  
- How channel creation and message loops work  
- How Discord handles rapid API requests  

I do **not** encourage or support using this bot to harm, disrupt, or raid servers.  
Misuse of this code may result in account bans or violations of Discord’s Terms of Service.  
Use it responsibly and only in controlled environments or your own test servers.

## 🛠️ About the Project

- Built with **Python**  
- One of the **first bots I ever made**  
- Very simple, but still functional  
- Useful as a reference for beginners learning how Discord bots work
